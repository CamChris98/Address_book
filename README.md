# Address_book
# Overview

I wrote this program in C++ to demonstrate the use of functions, classes, data structures, and other things in the C++ language

and how they help solve a problem one might have. 

I wrote the address book as a simple solution to writing things down on a piece of paper, this program will help you save paper and time. 

## Here is the demonstration video of my program:

# Development Environment

I used the Visual Studio IDE to write, compile, and run my program. 
I wrote the program in the C++ programming language and did not need to use any special libraries to do so.

# Future Work
Here are some things that could be done in the future with this application:
- Add the ability to add a description to each contact
- Create a real app with a GUI for it instead of it being in the console
